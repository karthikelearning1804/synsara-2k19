           <p>Incubated at IIT Madras Incubation Cell @IIT Madras Research Park<br>
          Lema Labs is a company founded by IIT Alumni under the guidance of faculty members of IIT Madras.<br>
          They are striving to build an ecosystem for emerging technologies by providing support to stakeholders which include student community, 
          educational institutions and the industry.</p>
          <br>
          <b>Internet Of Things</b><br><br>
          <p>Internet of Things
          It is defined as the network of physical objects – devices, vehicles, buildings and other items
          – embedded with sensors, electronics, software and network connectivity that enables these objects to get the ability to sense and communicate.
          <br>
          There are now about 4.6 billion connected devices excluding phones, tablets and laptops.<br>
          A number that is expected to increase to 15.3 billion in the next five years according to the Ericsson Mobility report.<br>
          A recent study released by Gartner says that 43% of all companies are using or plan to implement an IoT application.</p>
          <b>Machine Learning</b><br><br>
          <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.<br> In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.
          <br>
          Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it.<br> Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI</p>
